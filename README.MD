# Data Structures and Algorithms Revision

This repository is aimed for a quick go through of some common questions for data structures and algorithms. The solutions given are my attempt at these problems, if you have a better way of solving any of these these then do contribute.

Given a binary tree having N nodes, print its boundary traversal.

* [Check Cousins](./Binary_Trees/BT26_Check_Cousins.java)
Given the binary Tree and two nodes say ‘p’ and ‘q’. Determine whether the two nodes are cousins of each other or not.

* [Vertical Order](./Binary_Trees/BT27_Vertical_Order.java)
Print the nodes which are at same vertical order in same line separated by space. Print different levels in different lines.

* [Node Update](./Binary_Trees/BT28_Node_Update.java)
 Replace the node with sum of its children nodes(if child does not exist then consider it as zero). And return its preorder.
