# Recursion

Some problems Included are-

- [Check Palindrome](./RC0001_Check_Palindrome.java)
  Check whether a given String S is a palindrome using recursion. Return true or false.

- [Remove Duplicates](./RC0002_Remove_Duplicates.java)
  Given a string S, remove consecutive duplicates from it recursively.

- [Merge Sort](./RC0003_Merge_Sort.java)
  Sort an array A using Merge Sort.

- [Quick Sort](./RC0004_Quick_Sort.java)
  Sort an array A using Quick Sort.

- [Replace Pi](./RC0005_Replace_Pi.java)
  Given a string, compute recursively a new string where all appearances of "pi" have been replaced by "3.14".

- [Remove X](./RC0006_Remove_X.java)
  Given a string, compute recursively a new string where all 'x' chars have been removed.

- [String to Integer](./RC0007_String_To_Integer.java)
  Write a recursive function to convert a given string into the number it represents. That is input will be a numeric string that contains only numbers, you need to convert the string into corresponding integer and return the answer.

- [Pair Star](./RC0008_Pair_Star.java)
  Given a string S, compute recursively a new string where identical chars that are adjacent in the original string are separated from each other by a "\*".

- [Tower of Hanoi](./RC0009_Tower_Of_Hanoi.java)
  Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. Print the steps required to move n disks from source rod to destination rod.

- [Subsequences](./RC0010_Subsequences.java)
  Print and Return the subsequences of a string.

- [Keypad](./RC0011_Keypad.java)
  Given an integer n, using phone keypad find out all the possible strings that can be made using digits of input n.

- [Check AB](./RC0012_Check_AB.java)
  Suppose you have a string, S, made up of only 'a's and 'b's. Write a recursive function that checks if the string was generated using the following rules:

  - a. The string begins with an 'a'
  - b. Each 'a' is followed by nothing or an 'a' or "bb"
  - c. Each "bb" is followed by nothing or an 'a'
    If all the rules are followed by the given string, return true otherwise return false.

- [Staircase](./RC0013_Staircase.java)
  A child is running up a staircase with N steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up to the stairs. You need to return number of possible ways W.

- [Binary Search](./RC0014_Binary_Search.java)
  Binary Search using recursion.

- [Array Subsets](./RC0015_Array_Subsets.java)
  Given an integer array (of length n), find and return all the subsets of input array.
