# Binary Search Trees

* [Search in a BST](./BST0001_Search_Node.java)
Search a node in a given BST.

* [Elements between K1 and K2](./BST0002_Elements_Between_K1_K2.java)
Print all elements that lie between k1 and k2 in ascending order.

* [Convert Sorted Array To BST](./BST0003_Convert_Sorted_Array_To_BST.java)
Construct a balanced BST from a sorted array.

* [Check if a given tree is a bst](./BST0004_Check_Is_BST.java)
Check if a given tree is a bst or not.

* [Convert a given BST to Sorted Linked List](./BST0005_BST_To_Sorted_LL.java)
Convert a given BST to Sorted Linked List

* [Lowest Common Ancestor of BST](./BST0006_Lowest_Common_Ancestor.java)
Find the lowest common ancestor of 2 nodes.

* [Replace with sum of greater nodes](./BST0007_Replace_With_Sum.java)
Given a binary search tree, replace each nodes' data with the sum of all nodes' which are greater or equal than it.

* [Find path in a BST](./BST0008_Find_Path.java)
Given a BST and an integer k. Find and return the path from the node with data k and root.

* [BST Class from Scratch](./BST0009_BST.java)
A custom BST class consisting of operations like insertion, deletion, isPresent, printTree and getSize.

* [Level Wise LinkedList](./BST0010_Level_Wise_Linked_List.java)
Given a binary tree, write code to create a separate linked list for each level. You need to return the array which contains head of each level linked list.

* [Largest BST](./BST0011_Largest_BST.java)
Given a Binary tree, find the largest BST subtree. That is, you need to find the BST with maximum height in the given binary tree.

* [Pair Sum In A BST](./BST0012_Pair_Sum.java)
Given a binary search tree and an integer S, find pair of nodes in the BST which sum to S.

* [Merge 2 BSTS](./BST0013_Merge_BST.java)
Given two binary search trees ,merge the two given balanced BSTs into a balanced binary search tree.

* [Remove node](./BST0014_Remove_Node.java)
Given a BST (Binary search tree) with N number of nodes and a node X (which is definitely present in the input BST). You need to remove the node X and return the root of updated BST.

* [Floor of BST](./BST0015_Floor_BST.java)
Given a binary search tree and an integer.Find the floor value of a key in a binary search tree .

* [Sum in BST](./BST0016_Sum_BST.java)
You are given a BST and an integer k. You need to find the sum of k smallest elements of the BST.
